**Number of highlights:** 166


## Friday, January 1, 2021 10:03:30 AM

1. "Are these the right things for me/you/us to be focused on? If I/you/we complete them, will it be seen as a huge success? Do you have any feedback on how I/we could stretch even more?"


## Friday, January 1, 2021 10:09:09 AM

2. "Modern recognition is performance-based and horizontal. It crowdsources meritocracy. When JetBlue installed a value-driven, peer-to-peer recognition system, and leaders began noticing people who’d flown under their radar, metrics for employee satisfaction nearly doubled."


## Friday, January 1, 2021 10:10:25 AM

3. "Replace “Employee of the Month” with “Achievement of the Month.”"


## Friday, January 1, 2021 10:11:34 AM

4. "Make recognition frequent and attainable. Hail smaller accomplishments, too: that extra effort to meet a deadline, that special polish on a proposal, the little things a manager might take for granted."


## Friday, January 1, 2021 10:15:44 AM

5. "Anyone can cheer anyone else’s goal, irrespective of title or department. And mark this: Every cheer is a step toward operating excellence, the crowning purpose of OKRs and CFRs."


## Friday, January 1, 2021 10:25:48 AM

6. "once every six weeks. But in practice it happens every week. Everybody knows where they stand and how they’re contributing value to the company."


## Friday, January 1, 2021 10:25:53 AM

7. "Everybody knows where they stand and how they’re contributing value to the company."


## Friday, January 1, 2021 10:32:17 AM

8. "For a service business, nothing is more valuable than engaged employees who feel they can make a difference and want to stay with the organization."


## Friday, January 1, 2021 10:32:47 AM

9. "People aren’t wired to be nomads. They just need to find a place where they feel they can make a real impact."


## Friday, January 1, 2021 9:49:39 AM

10. "For companies moving to continuous performance management, the first step is blunt and straightforward: Divorce compensation (both raises and bonuses) from OKRs."


## Friday, January 1, 2021 9:51:01 AM

11. "when goals are used and abused to set compensation, employees can be counted on to sandbag. They start playing defense; they stop stretching for amazing. They get bored for lack of challenge. And the organization suffers most of all."


## Friday, January 1, 2021 9:56:13 AM

12. "A key point about a one-on-one: It should be regarded as the subordinate’s meeting, with its agenda and tone set by him."


## Friday, January 1, 2021 9:56:18 AM

13. "A key point about a one-on-one: It should be regarded as the subordinate’s meeting, with its agenda and tone set by him. . . . The supervisor is there to learn and coach."


## Friday, January 1, 2021 9:59:36 AM

14. "Goal setting and reflection , where the employee’s OKR plan is set for the coming cycle. The discussion focuses on how best to align individual objectives and key results with organizational priorities. Ongoing progress updates , the brief and data-driven check-ins on the employee’s real-time progress, with problem solving as needed. * Two-way coaching , to help contributors reach their potential and managers do a better job. Career growth , to develop skills, identify growth opportunities, and expand employees’ vision of their future at the company."


## Monday, December 7, 2020 8:00:18 AM

15. "Clear-cut time frames intensify our focus and commitment; nothing moves us forward like a deadline."


## Monday, December 7, 2020 8:05:19 AM

16. "The more ambitious the OKR, the greater the risk of overlooking a vital criterion. To safeguard quality while pushing for quantitative deliverables, one solution is to pair key results—to measure “both effect and counter-effect,”"


## Monday, December 7, 2020 8:08:36 AM

17. "Sometimes the “right” key results surface weeks or months after a goal is put into play. OKRs are inherently works in progress, not commandments chiseled in stone."


## Monday, December 7, 2020 8:09:16 AM

18. "A few goal-setting ground rules: Key results should be succinct, specific, and measurable. A mix of outputs and inputs is helpful. Finally, completion of all key results must result in attainment of the objective. If not, it’s not an OKR."


## Monday, December 7, 2020 8:11:51 AM

19. "Less Is More"


## Monday, December 7, 2020 8:13:08 AM

20. "How does the new goal stack up against my existing ones? Should something be dropped to make room for the new commitment?"


## Monday, December 7, 2020 8:15:59 AM

21. "OKRs are neither a catchall wish list nor the sum of a team’s mundane tasks."


## Monday, December 7, 2020 8:17:19 AM

22. "The art of management,” Grove wrote, “lies in the capacity to select from the many activities of seemingly comparable significance the one or two or three that provide leverage well beyond the others and concentrate on them.”"


## Monday, December 7, 2020 8:23:45 AM

23. "His start-up was exquisitely focused on teachers. I’ll never forget stepping into the bathroom of his tiny loft office and seeing a list of company objectives taped to the mirror, over the commode."


## Monday, December 7, 2020 8:23:55 AM

24. "Now there was a sign of serious goal orientation."

## Monday, January 4, 2021 12:34:59 PM

28. "Ideas are easy; execution is everything."


## Monday, January 4, 2021 12:43:50 PM

29. "Poorly done/managed OKRs are a waste of time, an empty management gesture. Well done OKRs are a motivational management tool that helps make it clear to teams what’s important, what to optimize, and what tradeoffs to make during their day-to-day work."


## Monday, January 4, 2021 12:44:11 PM

30. "express goals and intents; are aggressive yet realistic; must be tangible, objective, and unambiguous; should be obvious to a rational observer whether an objective has been achieved. The successful achievement of an objective must provide clear value for Google."


## Monday, January 4, 2021 12:45:27 PM

31. "express measurable milestones which, if achieved, will advance objective(s) in a useful manner to their constituents; must describe outcomes, not activities. If your KRs include words like “consult,” “help,” “analyze,” or “participate,” they describe activities. Instead, describe the end-user impact of these activities: “publish average and tail latency measurements from six Colossus cells by March 7,”"

If your KRs include words like “consult,” “help,” “analyze,” or “participate,” they describe activities. Instead, describe the end-user impact of these activities: “publish average and tail latency measurements from six Colossus cells by March 7,” rather than “assess Colossus latency”;"


## Monday, January 4, 2021 12:45:50 PM

33. "must include evidence of completion. This evidence must be available, credible, and easily discoverable. Examples of evidence include change lists, links to docs, notes, and published metrics reports."


## Monday, January 4, 2021 12:46:44 PM

34. "Many important projects at Google require contribution from different groups. OKRs are ideally suited to commit to this coordination. Cross-team OKRs should include all the groups who must materially participate in the OKR, and OKRs committing to each group’s contribution should appear explicitly in each such group’s OKRs. For example, if Ads Development and Ads SRE and Network Deployment must deliver to support a new ads service, then all three teams should have OKRs describing their"

35. "Many important projects at Google require contribution from different groups. OKRs are ideally suited to commit to this coordination. Cross-team OKRs should include all the groups who must materially participate in the OKR, and OKRs committing to each group’s contribution should appear explicitly in each such group’s OKRs. For example, if Ads Development and Ads SRE and Network Deployment must deliver to support a new ads service, then all three teams should have OKRs describing their commitment to deliver their part of the project."


## Monday, January 4, 2021 12:47:45 PM

36. "Commitments are OKRs that we agree will be achieved, and we will be willing to adjust schedules and resources to ensure that they are delivered. The expected score for a committed OKR is 1.0; a score of less than 1.0 requires explanation for the miss, as it shows errors in planning and/or execution. By contrast, aspirational OKRs express how we’d like the world to look, even though we have no clear idea how to get there and/or the resources necessary to deliver the OKR. Aspirational OKRs have an expected average score of 0.7, with high variance."


## Monday, January 4, 2021 12:49:03 PM

37. "“What could my [or my customers’] world look like in several years if we were freed from most constraints?”"


## Monday, January 4, 2021 12:50:04 PM

38. "A team’s committed OKRs should credibly consume most but not all of their available resources. Their committed + aspirational OKRs should credibly consume somewhat more than their available resources."


## Monday, January 4, 2021 12:51:49 PM

39. "OKRs must promise clear business value—otherwise, there’s no reason to expend resources doing them. Low Value Objectives (LVOs) are those for which, even if the Objective is completed with a 1.0, no one will notice or care."


## Monday, January 4, 2021 12:54:09 PM

40. "is critical that KRs are written such that scoring 1.0 on all key results generates a 1.0 score for the objective."


## Monday, January 4, 2021 12:54:12 PM

41. "It is critical that KRs are written such that scoring 1.0 on all key results generates a 1.0 score for the objective."


## Monday, January 4, 2021 12:58:46 PM

42. "Is it reasonably possible to score 1.0 on all the key results but still not achieve the intent of the objective? If so, add or rework the key results until their successful completion guarantees that the objective is also successfully completed."


## Monday, January 4, 2021 12:59:16 PM

43. "Teams who cannot credibly promise to deliver a 1.0 on a committed OKR must escalate promptly. This is a key point : Escalating in this (common) situation is not only OK, it is required."


## Monday, January 4, 2021 1:00:55 PM

44. "A committed OKR that fails to achieve a 1.0 by its due date requires a postmortem. This is not intended to punish teams. It is intended to understand what occurred in the planning and/or execution of the OKR, so that teams may improve their ability"


## Monday, January 4, 2021 1:00:59 PM

45. "A committed OKR that fails to achieve a 1.0 by its due date requires a postmortem. This is not intended to punish teams. It is intended to understand what occurred in the planning and/or execution of the OKR, so that teams may improve their ability to reliably hit 1.0 on committed OKRs."


## Monday, January 4, 2021 1:01:07 PM

46. "The corollary is that every new OKR is likely to involve some amount of escalation, since it requires a change to existing priorities and commitments."


## Monday, January 4, 2021 1:02:54 PM

47. "The OKRs’ priority should inform team members’ decisions on where to spend the remaining time they have after the group’s commitments are met."


## Monday, January 4, 2021 1:04:21 PM

48. "Aspirational OKRs and their associated priorities should remain on a team’s OKR list until they are completed, carrying them forward from quarter to quarter as necessary. Dropping them from the OKR list because of lack of progress is a mistake, as it disguises persistent problems of prioritization, resource availability, or a lack of understanding of the problem/solution."


## Monday, January 4, 2021 1:08:10 PM

49. "For larger groups, make OKRs hierarchical—have high-level ones for the entire team, more detailed ones for subteams. Make sure that the “horizontal” OKRs (projects that need multiple teams to contribute) have supporting key results in each subteam."


## Monday, January 4, 2021 1:30:46 PM

50. "Encourage a healthy proportion of bottom-up OKRs—roughly half."


## Monday, January 4, 2021 1:32:20 PM

51. "Make all lateral, cross-functional dependencies explicit."


## Monday, January 4, 2021 1:32:57 PM

52. "Motivate contributors less with extrinsic rewards and more with open, tangible measures of their achievement."


## Monday, January 4, 2021 1:33:36 PM

53. "To build a culture of accountability, install continuous reassessment and honest and objective grading—and start at the top. When leaders openly admit their missteps, contributors feel freer to take healthy risks."


## Monday, January 4, 2021 1:35:07 PM

54. "At the cycle’s end, use OKR grades plus subjective self-assessments to evaluate past performance, celebrate achievements, and plan and improve for the future. Before pushing into the next cycle, take a moment to reflect upon and savor what you’ve accomplished in the last one."


## Monday, January 4, 2021 1:36:52 PM

55. "To stimulate problem solving and spur people to greater achievement, set ambitious goals—even if it means some quarterly targets will be missed. But don’t set the bar so high that an OKR is obviously unrealistic. Morale suffers"


## Monday, January 4, 2021 1:36:56 PM

56. "To stimulate problem solving and spur people to greater achievement, set ambitious goals—even if it means some quarterly targets will be missed. But don’t set the bar so high that an OKR is obviously unrealistic. Morale suffers when people know they can’t succeed."


## Monday, January 4, 2021 1:37:12 PM

57. "To get leaps in productivity or innovation, follow Google’s “Gospel of 10x” and replace incremental OKRs with exponential ones. That’s how industries get disrupted and categories reinvented."


## Monday, January 4, 2021 1:40:35 PM

58. "Rely on intrinsic motivations—purposeful work and opportunities for growth—over financial incentives. They’re far more powerful."


## Monday, January 4, 2021 1:45:11 PM

59. "Promote peak performance with collaboration and accountability. When OKRs are collective, assign key results to individuals—and hold them accountable."


## Monday, January 4, 2021 1:45:29 PM

60. "To develop a high-motivation culture, balance OKR “catalysts,” actions that support the work, with CFR “nourishers,” acts of interpersonal support or even random acts of kindness."


## Monday, October 26, 2020 10:03:05 PM

61. "chasms in a single bound. A Soviet-born immigrant, he"


## Saturday, January 2, 2021 9:29:53 AM

62. "What’s neat about OKRs is that they formalize reflection. At least once each quarter, they make contributors step back into a quiet place and consider how their decisions align with the company. People start thinking in the macro."


## Saturday, January 2, 2021 9:31:28 AM

63. "So OKRs forge your people. They mint stronger executives and help them avoid rookie mistakes."


## Saturday, January 2, 2021 9:31:35 AM

64. "So OKRs forge your people. They mint stronger executives and help them avoid rookie mistakes. They implant the rigor and rhythm of a very large company into the framework of a very small company."


## Saturday, January 2, 2021 9:32:23 AM

65. "For those who stay, you’ve laid the foundation for engagement. Everybody’s bought in to the mission. Team sports don’t work unless the whole team plays together."


## Saturday, January 2, 2021 9:36:01 AM

66. "The OKR framework gives equal voice and weight to each department. No one needs to suffer in silence—truthfully, no one has that option. Your objectives will get their turn up on the screen, like everyone else’s, for comment and support."


## Saturday, January 2, 2021 9:36:59 AM

67. "I’d add that a really good company values different opinions. It mines for dissent, and it finds a way to bring it up to the surface and mine it out. That’s how we foster a meritocracy."


## Saturday, January 2, 2021 9:39:24 AM

68. "It wasn’t linked to an objective, per se, but it was absolutely a by-product of an early-stage OKR process. When something isn’t clearly delineated, it shows up right away. You can’t miss it."


## Saturday, January 2, 2021 9:42:08 AM

69. "There’s no judgment, just a problem to be solved. And guess what else happens? The two leads will advocate"


## Saturday, January 2, 2021 9:42:35 AM

70. "There’s no judgment, just a problem to be solved. And"


## Saturday, January 2, 2021 9:45:22 AM

71. "The agenda is you, the individual, and what you are trying to accomplish personally over the next two to three years, and how you’re breaking that into a two-week plan. I like to start with three questions: What makes you very happy? What saps your energy? How would you describe your dream job? Then"


## Saturday, January 2, 2021 9:45:27 AM

72. "The agenda is you, the individual, and what you are trying to accomplish personally over the next two to three years, and how you’re breaking that into a two-week plan. I like to start with three questions: What makes you very happy? What saps your energy? How would you describe your dream job?"


## Saturday, January 2, 2021 9:50:59 AM

73. "We have a best-idea-wins culture, and people are free to call out anybody, including the CEO."


## Saturday, January 2, 2021 9:51:58 AM

74. "one thing they had in common was this cold, sober focus. If you sat down with them for twenty minutes, they were completely uncluttered in their thinking. They could drill down very clearly on what needed to be done."


## Sunday, December 13, 2020 6:48:11 PM

75. "When employees align with a company’s top-line goals, their impact is amplified. They stop duplicating efforts or working counterproductively against the grain."


## Sunday, December 13, 2020 7:13:29 PM

76. "our bets these days, and they all stem from the OKR process. Focus and alignment"


## Sunday, December 20, 2020 11:03:46 AM

77. "God we trust; all others must bring data."


## Sunday, December 20, 2020 11:03:53 AM

78. "In God we trust; all others must bring data."


## Sunday, December 20, 2020 11:10:46 AM

79. "When you know you’re working on the right things, it’s easier to stay motivated."


## Sunday, December 20, 2020 11:11:36 AM

80. "They drive engagement. When you know you’re working on the right things, it’s easier to stay motivated."


## Sunday, December 20, 2020 11:13:08 AM

81. "For an OKR system to function effectively, the team deploying it—whether a group of top executives or an entire organization—must adopt it universally."


## Sunday, December 20, 2020 11:16:50 AM

82. "people crave to know how they’re progressing and see it visually represented, down to the percentage point. Research suggests that making measured headway can be more incentivizing than public recognition, monetary inducements, or even achieving the goal itself."


## Sunday, December 20, 2020 11:18:30 AM

83. "the simple act of writing down a goal increases your chances of reaching"


## Sunday, December 20, 2020 11:18:34 AM

84. "the simple act of writing down a goal increases your chances of reaching it."


## Sunday, December 20, 2020 11:21:50 AM

85. "OKRs are adaptable by nature. They’re meant to be guardrails,"


## Sunday, December 20, 2020 11:24:06 AM

86. "Whenever a key result or objective becomes obsolete or impractical, feel free to end it midstream. There’s no need to hold stubbornly to an outdated projection—strike it from your list and move on. Our goals are servants to our purpose, not the other way around."


## Sunday, December 20, 2020 11:26:14 AM

87. "Whenever a committed OKR is failing, a rescue plan is devised."


## Sunday, December 20, 2020 11:28:52 AM

88. "OKRs do not expire with completion of the work. As in any data-driven system, tremendous value can be gained from post hoc evaluation and analysis."


## Sunday, December 20, 2020 11:30:34 AM

89. "In scoring our OKRs, we mark what we’ve achieved and address how we might do it differently next time. A low score forces reassessment: Is the objective still worth pursuing? If so, what can we change to achieve it?"


## Sunday, December 20, 2020 11:34:47 AM

90. "If a department so much as approached 100 percent, it was presumed to be setting its sights too low—and there would be hell to pay."


## Sunday, December 20, 2020 11:41:01 AM

91. "Where OKR scores pinpoint what went right or wrong in the work, and how the team might improve, self-assessments drive a superior goal-setting process for the next quarter. There are no judgments, only learnings."


## Sunday, December 20, 2020 11:42:59 AM

92. "We do not learn from experience . . . we learn from reflecting on experience.”"


## Sunday, December 20, 2020 11:43:25 AM

93. "OKRs are inherently action oriented. But when action is relentless and unceasing, it can be a hamster wheel of grim striving. In my view, the key to satisfaction is to set aggressive goals, achieve most of them, pause to reflect on the achievement, and then repeat the cycle."


## Sunday, December 20, 2020 11:44:30 AM

94. "forward-looking at the same time. An unfinished objective might be rolled over to the next quarter, with a fresh set of key results—or perhaps its moment has passed, and it is appropriately"


## Sunday, December 20, 2020 11:44:44 AM

95. "OKR wrap-ups are retrospective and forward-looking at the same time."


## Sunday, December 20, 2020 11:45:08 AM

## Sunday, December 20, 2020 11:56:31 AM

97. "Having a good mission is not enough. You need a concrete objective, and you need to know how you’re going to get there."


## Sunday, January 3, 2021 10:49:49 AM

98. "Culture, as the saying goes, eats strategy for breakfast."


## Sunday, January 3, 2021 10:50:30 AM

99. "As you have seen throughout this book, OKRs are clear vessels for leaders’ priorities and insights. CFRs help ensure that those priorities and insights get transmitted."


## Sunday, January 3, 2021 10:51:13 AM

100. "Healthy culture and structured goal setting are interdependent. They’re natural partners in the quest for operating excellence."


## Sunday, January 3, 2021 11:18:12 AM

101. "culture is “a set of values and beliefs, as well as familiarity with the way things are done and should be done in a company. The point is that a strong and positive corporate culture is absolutely essential.”"

## Sunday, January 3, 2021 11:36:29 AM

106. "Dov’s big idea is that companies that “out-behave” their competition will also outperform them."

107. "These organizations don’t merely engage their workers. They inspire them. They replace rules with shared principles; carrots and sticks are supplanted by a common sense of purpose. They are built around trust, which enables risk"

## Sunday, January 3, 2021 11:44:48 AM

117. "Vision-based leadership beats command-and-control. The flatter the org chart, the more agile the organization. When performance management is a networked, two-way street, individuals grow into greatness."
